# openship

`openship = ++open_source`

## Motivation

Openship is a protocol to ship and share open source projects faster - with engineers and AI agents.

## About

SF Tech Week should also be about building - not just meeting! This project is currently a 5-days experiment about what the next iteration of open source could be.

## Current Status

Goal is to build a MVP quickly and code quality is not a focus - expect dragons.
